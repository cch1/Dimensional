# This library aims to provide effective parsing of user-supplied measures/metrics, intuitive scaling of those
# measures into a standard base scale unit and intuitive presentation of values.  It does not attempt to mixin
# unit-oriented methods into Ruby standard classes -to perform operations, particularly across dimensions, you
# will need to use basic conversion methods provided by this library combined with standard Ruby numerical oper-
# ations.  There is no method_missing magic or large mixin of spiffy unit-like methods here.

# The long-term objective for this library is to achieve compliance with the UCUM standard, with additional
# facilities for simple parsing and formatting of measures according to localized standards, and conversion
# of measures between units.  References:
